	<h1>The <em>former</em> home page of the RPI Electronics Club</h1>
	<h3>What happened to the RPI Electronics Club?</h3>
	<p>The RPI Electronics Club was shut down during the Summer of 2010.  This domain name passed through several hands, looking for a home, until it was finally reregistered by <a href="http://kenleycheung.com">Kenley Cheung</a> after the Embedded Hardware Club let it expire in 2013.  This website now provides information and resources about student-led software and hardware engineering research and development efforts at Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute.</p>
	<h3>What are some similar clubs and organizations?</h3>
	<ul>
		<li>The <a href="http://rpiehc.org">Embedded Hardware Club</a> is a Union-funded club dedicated to electronics development and can be considered to be the spiritual successor to the EClub.  The name could use some work.</li>
		<li>The Student Senate <a href="http://webtech.union.rpi.edu">Web Techologies Group</a> is an agency of the Senate that is responsible for the development and maintainence of several on-campus open-source projects.  They have worked with the EClub and RPI TV on the <a>Hockey Line Sign</a>.</li>

They also collaborated with the WTG and EClub on the Hockey Line Sign.</li>
		<li><a href="http://rcos.rpi.edu">RCOS</a> (Rensselaer Center for Open Source Software) is a research program under the RPI Computer Science department that supports undergraduate research in open-source software.  RCOS has supported students financially (with $$) and academically (with academic credit) when developing open-source projects.  They have provided support for various projects created by the organizations listed above.</li>
